A mini project to sovle maze with some AI algorithm
1. CATCHING MODE:
You will choose any of the following 4 algorithms (BFS, A Start, Simulated Analing, Backtracking with AC3), then move with the arrow buttons with the task of finding the key and reaching the destination without being caught by the alien bot
THIS IS MY DEMO FOR 4 ALGORITHM TO SOVLE THE MAZE 10x10
